## Very loose codingand naming convention

- Variables 
- Parameters prefixed with capital A
  - Local variables prefixed with capital L
  - Global variables prefixed with G
  - Constants (And globals vars) in all caps
- matching {} on same column
- Keep code loose, does not run any faster even how unreadable it is.
